We study one aspect of a generalization of Ringel’s famous Earth–Moon problem: what is the largest chromatic number of any thickness-2 graph? In particular, given a graph G we consider the r-inflation of G and find bounds on both the thickness and the chromatic number of the inflated graphs. In some instances, the best possible bounds on both the chromatic number and thickness are achieved. We end with several open problems.}

abstract="In 1976, the Four-Color Problem was solved: every map drawn on a sheet of paper can be colored with only four colors in such a way that countries sharing a common border receive different colors. This result was of interest to the mathematical community since many mathematicians had tried in vain for over a hundred years to prove this simple-sounding statement. Yet among mathematicians who were not aware of the developments leading to the proof, the outcome had rather dismaying aspects, for the proof made unprecedented use of computer computation; the correctness of the proof cannot be checked without the aid of a computer. Moreover, adding to the strangeness of the proof, some of the crucial ideas were perfected by computer experiments. One can never rule out the chance that a short proof of the Four-Color Theorem might some day be found, perhaps by the proverbial bright high-school student. But it is also conceivable that no such proof is possible. In this case a new and interesting type of theorem has appeared, one which has no proof of the traditional type.",

We overview both the combinatorial perspective (where only a combinatorial embedding of the graph is specified) and the geometric perspective (where the graph is embedded in the plane, vertices are points and edges are straight-line segments). We highlight the similarities and differences of the two settings, describe many extensions and generalizations, highlight algorithmic issues, outline several applications and mention open problems.}

We prove that Σn is isomorphic to the boundary complex of some (n − 3)-dimensional simplicial convex polytope, and that this polytope can be geometrically realized to have the dihedral group Dn as its group of symmetries. Formulas for the f-vector and h-vector of this polytope and some implications for related combinatorial problems are discussed.}
