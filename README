REVERSE SEARCH README

ADJECANCY ORACLE

Graph Adj (Graph *g, int i){}

We will have graph, and array of it's flippable edges, Adj(graph, i) will return graph with flipped edge at index i


LOCAL SEARCH

void localSearch(Graph *g){}

Returns graph with flipped edge, that is at the first index in it's array of flippable edges,

should remove the edge from it???


int root (perm v){return 1;}

if vertex is root of reverse search tree*//*if graph is a triang.gb(first loaded graph)?


int backtrack (perm v){return 1;}

from node v to its parent f(v) in reverse search tree*//*from graph, return its parent in flippableTree struct(from graph in array, return *graph and its index in the array, from the struct)


int reverse (perm v, int i){return 1;}

if neighbour of v (w = adj(v, i) is a child of v in reverse search tree(true/false)
returns true if graph (w = adj(v, i) is in the *neighbourGraphs[]


int output (){}

output result + dept(implement!)
return found graph
